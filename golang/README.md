# AI Gateway Go Implementation

This directory contains an experimental Go rewrite of the Rust-based AI Gateway.
It mirrors the original functionality with Gin-based HTTP endpoints, dynamic
model routing, guardrails, cost tracking, observability via OpenTelemetry, a
real-time terminal UI, and MCP tool integration.

The code is incomplete and serves as a starting point for a full-featured Go
version of the gateway.
