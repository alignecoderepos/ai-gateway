The repository provides a full Rust implementation of the AI Gateway and a partial rewrite under python/. The Python version already includes the main HTTP server, a CLI, routing logic, guardrail service, cost tracking, and in‑memory usage storage, but many features from the Rust project are missing or incomplete.

Summary

The Python rewrite still lacks several capabilities that exist in the Rust implementation or are referenced in docs/configs:

Provider Support
provider_registry attempts to load additional providers (Gemini, Bedrock, Azure, Mistral) that don’t exist in python/gateway/providers yet

Persistent Usage Storage
Only an InMemoryUsageStorage is implemented; there is no ClickHouse or other DB backend to match the analytics features described in the README.

Cost Control and Quotas
CostCalculator and UsageLimitChecker exist but no integration with persistent storage or enforcement via middleware. Cost is only approximated.

Comprehensive Guardrails
The Rust project integrates advanced guardrail evaluators. The Python version’s GuardrailsService only includes a regex-based evaluator; no LLM‑based or dataset evaluators.

Routing Engine
Only fallback, percentage, random, and a placeholder “optimized” strategy are implemented. Script‑based, latency-based, and nested routing described in ROUTING.md are not present.

Request Caching
Redis caching is referenced in dependencies and settings, but there is no caching middleware or cache backend implementation.

Authentication/OAuth
The middleware supports simple API keys loaded in memory. There is no OAuth integration or persistent key management as hinted in README.

Telemetry & Tracing
setup_tracing can send spans to an OTLP endpoint, but the ClickHouse tracing and TUI monitoring from the Rust version are not ported.

Rate Limiting and Budget Enforcement
Rate limiting is an in-memory implementation. There is no distributed or persistent rate limit store, nor enforcement of monthly/daily cost budgets.

CLI Features
The CLI includes serve, models, info, test, and update; missing commands like the Rust CLI’s interactive TUI (--interactive) and login functionality.

MCP/Tool Integrations
The root README shows examples of using MCP servers and UDFs. The Python codebase contains no MCP support or user-defined functions.

Testing & Validation
There are no unit tests in the Python directory, whereas the Rust project provides a full testing setup.

Advanced Model Definitions
Some features in models.yaml such as nested routers, script routing, and metrics-based routing are not reflected in the Python routing logic.

Overall, the Python version implements the core API endpoints and basic provider support (OpenAI/Anthropic) but lacks many enterprise features of the Rust implementation—persistent analytics, full provider set, advanced routing, guardrail evaluations, caching, budget enforcement, and observability tooling remain to be implemented.
